<p>We all know that QWERTY is here to stay and that most people can’t be bothered to learn a new keyboard layout and those who do quickly face hardware limitations which prevent them from giving exotic keyboard layouts a spin. We’re thankfully past the days when Kinesis and Maltron were the only available choices for keyboards with a thumb cluster but despite the rise of DIY ergonomic mechanical keyboards, getting your hands on an ergonomic keyboard is still cost-prohibitive.</p>

<p>Consequently, since the (potential) user base is so small — “small” is an understatement —, there aren’t a whole lot of Malt-like alternatives (for the sake of argument, “Malt-like” merely means any layout which puts a letter on a thumb key). Despite the odds, there <em>are</em> Malt-like layouts out there, all very recent.</p>

<p>Logical layouts/keymaps which add “E” on the thumb:</p>

<p>This short list will be exhaustive — leave a comment if there’s a Malt-like layout I’ve missed! — if we add in my mod to Colemak-DHm which moves “E” on the right thumb key, as opposed to all those other layouts which put the letter on the left. I’ve always pressed space with my left thumb and I’m not going to change that habit any time soon. Additionally, “E” was on the right hand to begin with so it makes sense to keep it on the right hand.</p>

<p>I had recently learned and become fluid in Colemak-DHm and, while I was curious to try out “E” on thumb after @frogmouth brought up the topic of RSTHD on the splitkb.com Discord server, I wasn’t too fond of the idea of learning a totally new layout right after having gotten comfortable with Colemak. Later maybe, but not now. Despite these qualms, I still like experimenting with keymaps. Thus, I went ahead and replaced the classic “E” position with merely shift (since I am using home row mods, the topic of a future blog post). At first, I wanted to keep backspace on the right home thumb position so I put “E” on the key to the left of it but I very quickly understood that this was a bad idea. The thumb key in question isn’t the most comfortable thumb key to hit and required lateral movement plus a repositioning of the thumb on its home position. For some reasons, my thumbs aren’t as good as my other fingers to find the home/resting position again so that “E” position was problematic. The solution would thus be to put “E” on my home right thumb key but I didn’t want to let go of backspace so I came up with another bad idea, magnitudes worse than the previous one. What if I turned the right thumb key into a dual-function key which yields “E” on tap and backspace on hold? Needless to say, it was impossible not to overshoot backspace like that.</p>

<p>Finally, I let go of my attachment to backspace’s position and let “E” take its place, pushing backspace to the left key, the previous position of delete.
At this point, the right thumb cluster looked like this:</p>

<p>Now, it was time to figure out how long it would take me to get back to ~80WPM using only the thumb for “E”.</p>

<p>After merely a few minutes of practicing “E” on thumb using the terminal application “<a href="https://github.com/cslarsen/wpm">wpm</a>”, I had already reached 57WPM for some sentences.</p>

<p><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/663573863480950808/726033697916190730/unknown.png?width=1260&amp;height=266" alt="screenshot of wpm showing 57.0 WPM" /></p>

<p>It didn’t take long to break through the 65WPM mark.</p>

<p>Then, I figured that I do not need to practice sentences with punctuations and capitalisations so much as I need to practice words containing “e” so I moved to <a href="https://monkey-type.com/">monkey-type.com</a>.
Only 32 minutes had passed since I flashed my keyboard with “E” on thumb and I am already getting real close to my goal of 80WPM.</p>

<p>At that point, I took a break and after a full day spent without any keyboard (or computer for that matter), I went back to my typing tests. This is when I reached my goal.</p>

<p>In fact, I even surpassed my goal.</p>

<p>Despite all that, I still wasn’t fully used to “E” on thumb yet. More often than not, I was still hitting the previous position of “E”. The screenshots I’ve shared here are the results of successful <em>sprints</em>, they do not really reflect the casual typing speed. Disclaimers aside, this still goes to show that it’s actually not so hard to get used to “E” on thumb, it has only taken me a few hours to get to an acceptable speed.</p>

<p>However, I still was not wholly convinced by the “E” thumb. It’s certainly nice to have a balanced load between the two thumbs but the rolls don’t feel as satisfying. In the end, I gave up on the “E” thumb. It just didn’t feel right in conjunction with Colemak. It wasn’t designed to take advantage of thumb keys.</p>
